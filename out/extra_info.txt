A screenshot of the original classification with the full dataset has been included as opposed to the txt file due to the original file being over-written in a test-run and not being able to run the full model again due to the computational limits on Worker2 leading up to the deadline. 

Please review the "full_data_classification_report.png" file for the true classification values of the model.
